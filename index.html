						<p>It isn't a detailed book about scrum implementation.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Thought it was good to give more understanding to scrum<br>
							I find it is always helpful to know the how and why<br>
							The development team has made a more concerted effort the last 6 months to implement this methodology<br>
							Although scrum was pioneered for software development this book also promotes it for use in other disciplines<br>
							You may see areas where we are improving<br>
							You may see ares where we need to improve
